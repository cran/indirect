\title{indirect: A package for assisting indirect elicitation of priors for generalised linear models.}
\description{
The \code{indirect} package provides three categories of functions: elicitation
functions, fitting functions and visualisation functions.
}
\section{Elicitation functions}{
 These are the functions that are used to 
  record expert opinion. This is where edits will be made and so on. The key 
  function is \code{\link{designLink}}, which defines a list object that contains
  information about the design and elicitation. The elicitations are recorded and updated
  via function \code{\link{elicitPt}}.
}

\section{Fitting functions}{
 These are generally helper functions except for the function 
  \code{\link{muSigma}} that is used for estimating the mean vector and covariance 
  matrix of the unknown coefficients for the multivariate normal prior. Helper functions 
  include \code{\link{mV}} for the elicited moments of conditional means priors.
}

\section{Visualisation functions}{
 These are functions for visualisation. The
  core function is \code{\link{plotDesignPoint}}.
